    <h4>School Opening Status</h4>
    <p>Latest data from the <a href="https://www.covideducationrecovery.global/">COVID-19 Global Education Recovery
        Tracker</a> <sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> shows that most countries have already opened schools partially (rural areas or parts of the
      country) and mostly with hybrid (combining remote and in-person) or mixed approaches. In many countries, the
      return is slow in the midst of debates about costs and benefits of returning to presential education. However, as
      of late August, very few countries depend solely on remote education. On the other hand, in Africa, a majority of
      countries have returned to in- person classes. In the northern hemisphere, the 2021-22 school year has begun or is
      about to begin, but it takes on the shape of a “new normal” as most are expected to return to in-person with
      additional sanitary protocols and adjusted schedules.</p>

    <h4>Teachers vaccination</h4>
    <p>While high-income countries are prioritizing or have prioritized <a href="/stories/2021-07-09-vaccination-for-teachers/">teacher vaccination</a> campaigns (with some moving
      towards universal access), the context varies more among low- and middle-income countries as many factors,
      such as vaccine scarcity and other populations being prioritized, reduce access to COVID-19 immunizations for
      teachers. As of September 1st, only 53% of countries had prioritized teachers’ vaccination.</p>

              To advance the catch up on content, the first two weeks of school will be a continuation of the
              remedial education programs that were launched August 15th, then the year’s curriculum will be
              introduced. In preparation, Jordan has prioritized teacher vaccinations and has reported that over 90%
              of teachers have been fully vaccinated. Those that are not will have a PCR test required every Sunday

          Countries are implementing diverse protection measures, as well as changes in schedules and school
          calendars. For example, <a href="/profile?de">Germany</a> has allocated <a href="https://twitter.com/bmfsfj/status/1415243688775720961?s=21">€200 million for air filtering
            devices</a> for preschools and primary schools to be installed as children return. In the <a href="/profile?us">USA</a>, the American Center for Disease Control (CDC) has updated the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">guidance for fully
            vaccinated people</a>. The CDC recommends universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students,
          and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status. Children should return to full-time
          in-person learning in the fall with layered prevention strategies in place. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/nyregion/nyc-schools-vaccine-mandate.html">New York City is
            requiring all Department of Education employees to have received at least one dose of a coronavirus
            vaccine by Sept. 27th</a>. <a href="/profile?tr">Turkey</a> is to reopen schools on Sept. 6th, and is
          considering mandating regular negative PCR tests from vaccine-hesitant parents as the country prepares to
          return to face-to-face education. <a href="/profile?sa">Saudi Arabia</a>’s school year will switch to a

        <strong>On learning losses</strong>
        <p>
          New studies estimating learning losses in specific countries have emerged. By the end of 2020 and early
          2021, a wave of studies with results from <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/3189074?limo=0">Belgium</a>,

            Kingdom</a> indicated both learning losses and increases in inequality. A second wave of studies has
          emerged on learning losses across countries:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059321000304">Ghana</a>, the
            estimated average learning loss amounts to 66% of previous learning gains in foundational numeracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            A study in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3841775">Brazil</a> (Sao Paolo),
            where data was collected at the beginning and the end of 2020, shows that students learned 27.5% of what
            they would have learned if in-person classes had continued as usual.
          </li>
          <li>
            Emerging evidence from <a href="https://riseprogramme.org/blog/learning-inequalities-widen-COVID-19-Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>
            showed that children only learned between 30% to 40% as much in math as during a normal year, and that
            the learning gap between urban and rural students has increased.
          </li>
          <li>
            A randomized control trial in <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28205/w28205.pdf">Botswana</a> focused on
            using low-tech interventions to minimize learning loss during the pandemic shows that using mobile text
            messages and phone calls to encourage parents to support their child’s learning while out of school can
            be effective. A combined strategy of texts and calls cost-effectively improved learning by 0.12 standard
            deviations.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cars.12334">Canada</a> (Ontario), learning
            losses are estimated to represent 3.5 and 6.5 months among typically performing and lower-performing
            students.

          <li>
            A study in <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/wpaper/halshs-02901505.html">China</a> that uses
            administrative data from Chinese middle schools, shows that receiving online education during school
            closures improved student results by 0.22 standard deviations, compared to students without learning
            support from their school.

            Research in <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/student-speech-development-slowed-by-lockdowns-20210820-p58kek.html">Australia</a>
            (Victoria) shows deterioration of speech development due to lockdowns. UNICEF Australia surveyed 1,000
            parents nationally and found that learning loss was the second biggest reason parents backed reopening
            schools, after mental health concerns. About 27% of parents said they were concerned their child would
            not be able to catch up.

            At the global level COVID-19 disruptions are estimated to impact <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13658">early childhood students</a>
            in 19.01 billion person-days of instruction lost, 10.75 million additional children falling “off track”

            adulthood.

            large, randomized control trial (RCT) in Bangladesh supports mask wearing</a>. The study, which included
          40,000 adults across 600 villages in rural Bangladesh, finds that mask-wearing can have a significant
          impact on limiting the spread of symptomatic COVID-19. It also showed that relatively low-cost, targeted
          interventions to promote mask-wearing can significantly increase the use of face coverings in rural,
          low-income countries.

            brief outlined the importance of holistic learning</a>, especially in the face of COVID-19, as being
          imperative when schools set out to help students catch up. As the new academic year begins, schools are

          that will help educators move children forward after a year of tumult by addressing any unfinished content
          from the previous year within grade-level lessons. As schools and communities work to better education for
          the next year, it is vital that they also use the best science of learning to teach children in ways that
          reflect how the human brain learns.

          As issues of social justice become more present and urgent in our world, Pearson asked 5,000 people
          globally, to examine what they learned, and what they need to learn, when it comes to race and gender
          equality. Globally, <a href="https://plc.pearson.com/sites/pearson-corp/files/GLS/GLS-2021-Equity-One-Pager_Global.pdf">59%
            don’t believe their education adequately covered topics of race and gender equality</a>, with younger
          generations reporting better satisfaction with how these topics were covered.
